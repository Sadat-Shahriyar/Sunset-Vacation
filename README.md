# Sunset-Vacation

This project is a community-based platform for listing and renting local homes, connecting hosts and travelers without owning any properties itself. It features a JWT-based authentication system, a search and recommendation system for travelers to find properties based on location, and Stripe API integration for monetary transactions. The platform also includes a map view using the OpenStreetMap API to display property locations, a chat system for communication between hosts and travelers, and a social Q&A section where users can ask and answer questions about travel destinations and seek suggestions.
